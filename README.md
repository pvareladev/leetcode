# My Leetcode solutions

Hi there!
In this repo I'll be uploading my solutions for Leetcode problems. Since I'm mostly a PHP oriented developer, that's the language for this repo.

What I'm trying to record are the first solutions I've found that passed all tests. This might allow me to come back to see how I used to solve things before and check my progress as a developer.

This might also serve a tool for recruiters to come along and check how I write code.

Feel free to contact me for help or suggestions if any you're interested!
